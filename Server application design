Server application design : 1.Iterative Server - Serves one connection/client at a time
2 client in the queue waits till the first client has terminated only then server 
serves the client2. After accept system call i.e accept(), a new client socket is created 
of same type now code enters into while loop and server receives the client data and processes 
the data. Now the program will come out of inner while loop only when client closes the connection.
Once client closes, server again executing the accept system call and ready for a new client.
Iterative servers have simple interface. If each client's transaction duration is less then 
iterative servers are good. 
                            2.Concurrent Server - Manages/Serves multiple client at a time
 
 Similarity between TCP and fifo
 N/W Comm.(TCP) & IPC(fifo) both are connection oriented.
 Both support string data transmission.
 In UDP and ,msgq data transmission is by packet data transmission.
 In UDP and msgq there is no extra security.
 
 netstat : netstat is an open source tool for network statistics, it talks about how your computer is 
 communicating with other computers or networking devices. And is also provides detailed information of individula network communication.
 also protocol information. This information is used for trouble shooting and diagnostic purposes.
 
 netstat -tulpn , here 
                t= tcp
                u= udp
                l= listen
                p= pid of the program
                n= name of the program
 
 functions to get information like cat services in etc folder.
 A file called services in etc folder shows all the services that are used by client application
 from your computer. A function called getservent() will read the next line of services file in etc 
 folder and return a pointer to next entry in services file.
